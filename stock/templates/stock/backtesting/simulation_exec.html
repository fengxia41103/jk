Backtesting 2 simulation

<div>
<p>
The core of backtesting 2 strategies is to compute a "factor value" for each historical record. Based on the strategy and specified cutoff values, it simulates trades and generate a report.

<h3>Data source</h3>
	<ul>
		<li> S&P 500 stocks</li>
		<li> "CI00" sector</li>
		<li> "8821" WIND sector</li>
		<li> China stocks</li>
	</ul>
Special symbol "000001" is the China equivalent of S&P500 index.

<h3>Trading strategy</h3>
<h4>by daily ranking</h4>
<p>
Given a date, we rank samples by precomputed "factor value". We buy symbols whose rank falls into a band defined by "buy_cutoff" and "sell_cutoff".

<p>
Rank defaults to ascending order. The meaning of it depends on how the factor value is calculated. Eg. factor value using daily return = (close[t0] - close[t-1])/close[t-1], ascending order means we will buy stock whose price has dropped the most on t0 &rarr; we chase losers; descending order would reverse this logic &rarr; we chase winners.

<h4>buy low sell high</h4>
<p>
Based on "daily return", if buy_cutoff is 0.04, we buy stocks whose has seen a daily price DROP greater than 0.04; if sell_cutoff is 0.05, we sell stocks whose daily price INCREASE is greater than 0.05. For this strategy, sorting is irrelevant.
